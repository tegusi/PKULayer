# PKULayer

This is a naive tool to generate and upload mock running track in PKURunner. Since the PKURunner app is not stable, I can't guarantee full availability in long term. GPXPY and requests is required.

## Installation
Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/tegusi/PKULayer
```
Cd repo folder:
```
cd PKULayer
```
Use pip to install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Run the script and input the values it requires.

For advanced users, you can modify the code as you like. You can see the url captured from Charles.

## Credits
I hold the view that everyone should have the right that he chooses where and when to run as his wish.
